Welcome to SSP_Tools's documentation!
=====================================

``SSP_Tools`` is a MATLAB toolbox which provides an easy and robust platform
for testing numerical methods on example hyperbolic problems. It's goal is to 
significantly reduce the amount of programming legwork required to perform 
numerical approximations and provide a rigorous environment for numerical 
experiments.

``SSP_Tools`` was originally written to support investigations into the Stong Stability
Preserving properties of Multistep Multistage Runge-Kutta methods, but since then
it has expanded in scope to encompass additional research.

The latest version of ``SSP_Tools`` may be downloaded at the project's `github page <https://github.com/DanielHiggs/SSP_Tools>`_.
