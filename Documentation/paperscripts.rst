Paper Scripts
=============

These scripts requite SSP_Tools. The most updated version of SSP_Tools
can be downloaded at the project's `github <https://github.com/DanielHiggs/SSP_Tools>`_.

MSRK Paper
----------

The following scripts were used to generate paper for the MSRK paper. They were
run using the version of SSP_Tools that can be downloaded `here </paper_scripts/archived_ssptools/SSP_Tools-MSRK.zip>`_


Example 1: van der Pol Convergence Study
