SSP_Tools
=========

SSP_Tools is a MATLAB toolkit for investigating the Strong Stability Preserving (SSP) properties of numerical methods that
approximate solutions to conservative hyperbolic partial differential equations. 

More information about SSP methods and current researh projects can be found at the http://www.sspsite.org
